Hi Professor D!

I've been working on Allegro for the last few weeks since I've been back 
from Italy, revamping already completed code, putting in your corrections, 
and cleaning up a great deal of it.  I have two functions left which I'm 
not sure about approaching, namely Alg_track::serialize and 
Alg_track::unserialize; I could use your help on those.  With exception to 
these two, though, the rest is completed and clean.

Here are a few notes for review:
- Because of a number of changes in allegro.h/.cpp, some of the other files 
in the Allegro project like allegrosmfrd.cpp needed a few modicications for 
everything to compile.    Let me know if you want me to send those other 
files with those modifications; they're all minimal, from changing "len" to 
"length()" to simple pointer issues.  It might be a pain to go through all 
of them.
- To resolve the Alg_events vs. Alg_event_list issue, I decided to have 
Alg_event_list inherit Alg_events.  I've gone over the 
accessibility/security issues related, and I strongly believe it is the 
best solution.  It's also made the code a great deal more readable and 
intuitive (no more event_list->events->events[i]'s).
- Alg_midifile_reader uses Alg_events::append(), which you wanted to be 
protected.  Both append() and insert() are currently public.
- I took the conditional you wrote for the overlap() auxiliary function 
(for the track::cut/copy functions) and reduced/simplified it.  Let me know 
what you think.


I'll be here in Albuquerque with plenty of time to spare until the 22nd 
when I come back to Pittsburgh.  I'm not sure what the best approach would 
be to debug the code efficiently, but if you'd like me to work on that, let 
me know and I'll give it my best.

Ciao,
David
